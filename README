# Debian package buildscripts

This repository contains a collection of self-contained scripts which can be used to download & build debian packages.

This is most useful when the version in official package repositories is outdated and you just want to build the package without worrying about complex build processes.

The script automatically
- Download the correct version of the package
- Unpack it
- Create the `debian` folder
- Build the package (including a `-dev` package)

### Installing dependencies

(only partially finished)

```sh
sudo apt-get install devscripts [...]
```

### Building a debian buildscript

Simply run the buildscript, e.g.:

```sh
./deb-jemalloc.sh
```

If the build succeeds, this will create `.deb` packages. Else, look at the error messages, usually some packages are missing.
